# Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Lab Programs (4th Semester, UVCE, Bengaluru)

## Overview

This repository contains Java implementations of programs from the prescribed lab manual for the subject **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** in the 4th semester of Information Science and Engineering at UVCE, Bengaluru. The programs focus on various algorithmic techniques and their efficiency in solving computational problems.

## Program List

The following programs have been implemented:

1. [**Program 1: Merge Sort**](./program01/)
   - **Description**: Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, which follows the divide and conquer technique to sort an array.

2. [**Program 2: Quick Sort**](./program02/)
   - **Description**: Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm, another divide and conquer method to sort an array efficiently.

3. [**Program 3: Binary Search Tree**](./program03/)
   - **Description**: Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

4. [**Program 4: Breadth-First Search**](./program04/)
   - **Description**: Implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal or searching.

5. [**Program 5: Topological Sort**](./program05/)
   - **Description**: Implementation of Topological Sorting for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

6. [**Program 6: Warshall's Algorithm**](./program06/)
   - **Description**: Implementation of Warshall's algorithm to find the transitive closure of a directed graph.
